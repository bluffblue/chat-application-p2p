# Security Policy

## ðŸš¨ Security Notice

This is a **basic demonstration project** and is **NOT** intended for production use. The security implementations are basic and for educational purposes only.

## Known Security Limitations

### 1. Encryption
- Basic AES encryption implementation
- Static encryption key
- No secure key exchange mechanism
- No perfect forward secrecy
- No certificate validation

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- No user authentication
- No session management
- No access control
- No user verification
- No rate limiting

### 3. Network Security
- No TLS/SSL implementation
- Plain TCP connections
- No protection against MITM attacks
- No IP filtering
- No DDoS protection

### 4. Data Security
- No message persistence security
- No secure data deletion
- No data validation
- No input sanitization
- No protection against SQL injection (if DB is added)

### 5. Other Security Concerns
- No audit logging
- No security monitoring
- No brute force protection
- No secure password storage
- No secure configuration management

## Security Best Practices (Not Implemented)

For a production environment, you should implement:

1. **Encryption**
   - Proper key exchange (e.g., Diffie-Hellman)
   - TLS/SSL for all connections
   - Perfect forward secrecy
   - Secure random number generation
   - Certificate validation

2. **Authentication**
   - Strong password policies
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Session management
   - Token-based authentication
   - Secure password storage (e.g., bcrypt)

3. **Network Security**
   - HTTPS/WSS for all connections
   - IP whitelisting
   - Rate limiting
   - DDoS protection
   - Firewall configuration

4. **Data Protection**
   - Input validation
   - Output encoding
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS prevention
   - CSRF protection

5. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Security audit logs
   - Intrusion detection
   - Activity monitoring
   - Error logging
   - Performance monitoring

## Reporting Security Issues

Since this is a demonstration project, there is no formal security reporting process. However, if you find security issues:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Send details to [your.email@example.com](mailto:your.email@example.com)
3. Include "Security Issue" in the subject line

## For Production Use

If you need a secure chat application for production:

1. Use established, well-tested chat platforms
2. Implement proper security measures
3. Conduct security audits
4. Follow compliance requirements
5. Maintain regular security updates
